## Howdy, Iâ€™m @ArtificialElements!
I really like coding, drawing, animating, and all in all seeing what entertainment I can make digitally.

I do a lot of stuff, and even when it comes to programming specifically I've used a lot of different languages and engines, but Unity is my favorite program to use for visual stuff. For text based stuff though, Python is my go-to language.
